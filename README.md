# Twitch Chat IRC, read only, in the terminal.

### What it looks like:
![preview](./images/preview.png)

### Setup:
1. Copy all placeholder files from `.env_example` to `.env`
2. `NICKNAME` is your Twitch username, `CHANNEL` is the livestreamer's username, and you get `TOKEN` [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
3. run `cargo run --release`, and you're good to go!

### TODO:
- I'll get the binary working eventually.
- `yay` support, soon.

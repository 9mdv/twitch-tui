# Introduction

`twitch-tui` is a Terminal User Interface for reading and interacting with Twitch chat users.

The ideal setup would be this application and [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink), to obliterate all need for a browser while watching streams.

This book is still under construction, so some sections might still be missing. Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Xithrius/twitch-tui/issues/new/choose) if you find that something needs improvement.
